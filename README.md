# My Firebase Apps

A repository containing all of the Firebase apps I coded. Each app resides in its own dedicated folder. Here's a brief overview of each app:

## Firebase Add To Cart App
This is a simple shopping cart progressive web app I made to test out Firebase Realtime Database. It allows users to store their grocery list in the app through the database, making it easy to remember what they need to buy.

## Firebase Social App
This is a simple social media progressive web app I made to test out Firebase authentication and Cloud Firestore. The app lets a user sign in with email or Google and lets them create posts which are stored in Firebase's database.

Feel free to explore each folder for more details about each app.
