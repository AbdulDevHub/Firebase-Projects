# Simple Firebase Projects

This repository serves as a collection of various Firebase projects. Each project resides in its own dedicated folder. Here's a brief overview of each project:

## [Firebase Add To Cart App](./Firebase%20Add%20To%20Cart%20Web%20App)

This is a simple shopping cart progressive web app I made to test out Firebase Realtime Database. It allows users to store their grocery list in the app through the database, making it easy to remember what they need to buy.

## [Firebase Social App](./Firebase%20Social%20Media%20Web%20App)

This is a simple social media progressive web app I made to test out Firebase authentication and Cloud Firestore. The app lets a user sign in with email or Google and lets them create posts which are stored in Firebase's database.
